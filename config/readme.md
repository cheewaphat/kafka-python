### Python ConfigParser Example

This is some simple illustrative code for Python's ConfigParser module, written as I was trying to figure out how to store more complex data structures in config files.

In addition to the normal stuff, such as getting a single variable/value from a config file, this code also illustrates how to configure and access complex data structures from your config files, such as 

* dicts
* lists
* nested data structures (e.g. lists within a dict)
